#### Writing new pages for the site:
two ways, depending on how involved you want to be.

Simplest:

- just write out the page you want in markdown, then
ping Mik or Dan and tell them what folder you want it nested under and whether it should be linked from home page.

More Involved:
- clone down the repository: [github](https://github.com/DanGrund/pv-handbook)
- add folders/files under `src/content/docs` just follow the existing structure it's pretty self explanatory.
- you have to do this on a feature branch, then push up and open a pull request. pushing main is blocked.
