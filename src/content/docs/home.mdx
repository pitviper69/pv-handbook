#### Writing new pages for the site:
two ways, depending on how involved you want to be.

Simplest:
- Just send a list of what you want to have displayed and the name of the page to Dan


Slightly More Involved:
- If you want control over how it displays or want something a little more involved, take a few  minutes to learn how
to write markdown. [How to write new pages for this site](./web/authoring-content-in-md) Then,
- Write out the page you want and ask Mik or Dan and tell them where to put it on the site.


Most Involved (really just for Troy ya fuckin nerd):
- clone down the repository: [github](https://github.com/DanGrund/pv-handbook)
- add folders/files under `src/content/docs` just follow the existing structure it's pretty self explanatory.
- you have to do this on a feature branch, then push up and open a pull request. pushing main is blocked.
