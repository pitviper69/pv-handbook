## Money Factory Network Config
visit https://192.168.0.9, admin password is saved in 1password (tbh I'm not sure which address it's ACTUALLY at but all of the network access points will tell you which path to go to. it used to be .0.5, then .0.1, now its .0.9?)

once in the dashboard, on the left side is a nav menu. under devices you can check the status of the four access points and the two switches. here you can reset individual devices.

on the [settings screen] (https://192.168.0.9/#siteSettings) you can go down to the services tab on the left side, then in the sub menu, across the top find 'Reboot Schedule' where the two reboots for the access points and switches are set up. If the network starts resetting at odd times, it means the system clock on the switch has gone out of sync, and it just needs to be reset through this dashboard
