## Scheduling Sales Pricing

1. Open Matrixify from Shopify Apps Menu
2. Create an export for products with the following columns, and whatever additional filters you need, e.g.
contains specific tag, etc.
    - Basic Columns: ID, Handle, Type, Tags, Tags Command, Status, Published
    - Inventory/Variants: Variant ID, Variant Command, Option 1 & 2 Name & Value, Variant SKU, Variant Price,
   Variant Compare-at Price, Variant Inventory Qty
3. Save this export with the store name prefixed and the date, e.g. `USA_presaleExport_20241106`
4. Open the export in excel/sheets
5. immediately `save as` with a different title, you'll want to retain the original export file. For example, save as `USA_VeteransDay40off`
6. Delete rows where inventory = 0
7. Delete rows where published = false
8. Delete rows where product = SavedBy Package Protection
9. Delete rows where product = Gift Card
10. Delete rows where product = Nosepiece 2000+
11. Create temporary column labeled `Variant Compare At Price` with formula
`=IF(ISBLANK(Old Compare-At Price Column), Old Variant Price, Old Compare-At Price)`
12. create temporary column labeled `Variant Price` with formula
`=IF(ISBLANK(Old Compare-At Price), Old Variant Price * 0.6, Old Variant Price)`
13. Select these two columns, Copy, then Paste Special-Values Only over the same columns.
14. Delete the old `Variant Compare At Price` and `Variant Price` Columns
15. Delete `tags`, `tags command`, `variant qty` `status`, `published` columns (to avoid accidentally overwriting any changes made between product export and scheduled import)
16. Save the spreadsheet (duh I know but we all fuck this up)
17. Back in matrixify, click add file in the import tab at the top and select the sale spreadsheet
18. Open the `Options` drawer, and select the `schedule on` checkbox. Be sure to note the expected import time and import with a buffer before the scheduled sale time.
19. Repeat the import scheduling with the pre-sale pricing for whenever the sale ends.
