title: Authoring Content in Markdown or MDX
---

This supports the full range of Markdown syntax in  `.md` files as well as frontmatter YAML to define metadata such as a title and description.
It also supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files, which extend Markdown by allowing the inclusion of React components within your content.
This enables dynamic and interactive documentation. We specifically use [GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)](https://mdxjs.com/guides/gfm/).


## Frontmatter

You can modify individual pages in these docs by setting values in their frontmatter. Frontmatter is set at the top of your files between `---` separators.

```md
---
title: Sample
---

Page content goes here, after `---`.
```

Every page must include at least a `title`. See the [frontmatter reference](/web/frontmatter-ref) for all available fields and how to add custom fields.

## Inline styles

Text can be **bold**, _italic_ or ~~strikethrough~~.

```md
Text can be **bold**, _italic_ or ~~strikethrough~~.
```

You can [link to another page](/home).

```md
You can [link to another page](/home).
```

You can highlight `inline code` with backticks. 

```md
You can highlight `inline code` with backticks. 
```

## Images

Images in these Docs use [Astro's built-in optimized asset support](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/).

Markdown and MDX support the Markdown syntax for displaying images that includes alt-text for screen readers and assistive technology.

```md
![An illustration of planets and stars featuring the word “astro”](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withastro/docs/main/public/default-og-image.png)
```

Relative image paths are also supported for images stored locally in your project.

```md

```

## Headings

You can structure content using a heading. Headings in Markdown are indicated by a number of # at the start of the line.

### How to structure page content

Docs are configured to automatically use your page title as a top-level heading and will include an “Overview” heading
at top of each page's table of contents. We recommend starting each page with regular paragraph text content and using on-page headings from `<h2>` and down:

```md
---
title: Markdown Guide
description: How to use Markdown
---

This page describes how to use Markdown.

## Inline Styles

## Headings
```

### Automatic heading anchor links

Using headings in Markdown will automatically give you anchor links so you can link directly to certain sections of your page:

```
---
title: My page of content
description: How to use docs's built-in anchor links
---

## Introduction

I can link to [my conclusion](#conclusion) lower on the same page.

## Conclusion

`https://my-site.com/page1/#introduction` navigates directly to my Introduction.
```

Level 2 (`<h2>`) and Level 3 (`<h3>`) headings will automatically appear in the page table of contents.

Learn more about how Astro processes heading ids in the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#heading-ids).

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote, which is commonly used when quoting another person or document.
>
> Blockquotes are indicated by a `>` at the start of each line.

```md
> This is a blockquote, which is commonly used when quoting another person or document.
>
> Blockquotes are indicated by a `>` at the start of each line.
```

## Code blocks

A code block is indicated by a block with three backticks ``` at the start and end. You can indicate the programming language being used after the opening backticks.

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);
  return true;
};
```


````text
```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);
  return true;
};
```
````

## Details

Details (also known as “disclosures” or “accordions”) are useful to hide content that is not immediately relevant. Users can click a short summary to expand and view the full content.

Use the standard HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` elements in your Markdown content to create a disclosure widget.

You can nest any other Markdown syntax inside a `<details>` element.

<details>
<summary>Where and when is the Andromeda constellation most visible?</summary>

The [Andromeda constellation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)>) is most visible in the night sky during the month of November at latitudes between `+90°` and `-40°`.

</details>

```html
<details>
<summary>Where and when is the Andromeda constellation most visible?</summary>

The [Andromeda constellation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(constellation)>) is most visible in the night sky during the month of November at latitudes between `+90°` and `-40°`.

</details>
```

## Other common Markdown features

These docs support all other Markdown authoring syntax, such as lists and tables.
See the [Markdown Cheat Sheet from The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements.

# MDX

## Using a component

You can use a component by importing it into your MDX file and then rendering it as a JSX tag. These look like HTML tags but start with an uppercase letter matching the name in your import statement:

```mdx
---
title: Welcome to my docs
---

import Callout from "@/components/Callout.astro";

<Callout variant="info">
Sample callout
</Callout>
```
See the [components](/guides/components) for all custom components and their available fields.


### Task Lists

You can create task lists using GFM syntax.

- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

```md
- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
```

### Tables

You can also create tables using GFM.

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

```md
| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |
```
### Strikethrough

Strikethrough text can be created using double tilde `~~`.

This is ~~strikethrough~~ text.

```md
This is ~~strikethrough~~ text.
```


## Using JavaScript Expressions

MDX allows you to use JavaScript expressions within your content. This can be useful for dynamic content and calculations.

Current year: {new Date().getFullYear()}

```mdx
Current year: {new Date().getFullYear()}
```


```mdx
**Fibonacci Sequence**

The first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are:

{
  Array.from({ length: 10 }).map((_, i) => (
    <span key={i}>{fibonacci(i)} </span>
  ))
}
```

## Syntax Highlighting

MDX supports syntax highlighting for code blocks using backticks. You can specify the language for proper highlighting.

````mdx
```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div>Hello, MDX!</div>;
};
```
````
